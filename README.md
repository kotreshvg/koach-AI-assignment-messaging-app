It is not nessesary to run react serve
open the directory in ternimal and use the command "node server.js"
Server will be running at port number 4001
open your browser and go to localhost:4001
you will see a chatting window in green color
you need to enter your name in the given field and text message in text area
press send to send th text message
you can open the same text app in other tab to see the sent message and received message

note : once the server turned off you cannot access previous messages 
message history is not implemented in the server

though you can do that by creating Nosql database
